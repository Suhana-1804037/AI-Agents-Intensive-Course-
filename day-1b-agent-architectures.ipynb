Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**. This is a team of simple, specialized agents that collaborate, just like a real-world team. Each agent has one clear job (e.g., one agent *only* does research, another *only* writes).

What if you could delegate tasks, foster collaboration, and unlock new levels of efficiency within your own code? Get ready to discover how Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are revolutionizing software development, one intelligent agent at a time.\n\nAt its core, MAS leverages the **power of specialization**. Imagine breaking down a mammoth task into smaller, well-defined jobs, each handled by an independent agent. This dramatically simplifies your codebase, reduces cognitive load for developers, and makes debugging and maintenance a breeze, as issues are often isolated to specific agents.\n\nBut it doesn't stop at individual efficiency. MAS shines in **enhanced collaboration**. These agents can communicate, coordinate, and work together like a finely tuned team. This allows for sophisticated, emergent behaviors to arise from simple interactions and facilitates the creation of dynamic, distributed systems where tasks are intelligently allocated.\n\nFurthermore, MAS imbues your software with remarkable **adaptability and resilience**. Need to pivot to new requirements? Systems can reconfigure themselves by adjusting agents. Encounter a failure? Other agents can often pick up the slack, leading to significantly increased fault tolerance and scalability.\n\nFinally, MAS unlocks **new possibilities** for truly intelligent applications. Think systems that learn, reason, and act autonomously, opening doors to advanced AI automation, complex simulations, and intelligent assistants. For problems too vast for monolithic solutions, MAS offers a powerful new paradigm.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems are more than just a buzzword; they represent a fundamental shift.

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-14T17:53:43.075944Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-14T17:53:43.076775Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-14T17:53:43.082753Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-14T17:53:43.076739Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-14T17:53:43.081685Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

lighthouse railing, the salt spray a familiar kiss on his weathered face. For twenty years, his life had been dictated by the rhythm of the waves and the sweep of the beam. Then, tucked beneath a loose stone near the lantern room, he found it. Not a logbook, nor a sailor’s forgotten trinket, but a map. Parchment, impossibly smooth, etched with lines that pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence. Islands he’d never seen, coastlines that defied known geography, all shimmering with an eerie, blue-green light. It wasn't charted on any Admiralty list. Elias, his heart thrumming a new, unfamiliar beat, unfurled the glowing map, a silent question forming on his lips. Where did this lead?\nCriticAgent > Here are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Expand on Elias's Character and Motivation:** While Elias is established as a solitary, routine-bound lighthouse keeper, we don't know *why* he's in this solitary life or what he truly desires beyond the predictable rhythm. Adding a brief internal reflection or a detail about his past (e.g., a lost love, a longing for adventure he never pursued) would make his fascination with the map more compelling and give him a stronger motivation to follow it.\n\n2.  **Enhance the Sensory Details of the Map:** The description of the map is good, but could be even more evocative. Instead of just \"lines that pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence,\" consider describing the texture of the parchment more deeply (is it cool to the touch? Does it feel ancient?), the *quality* of the light (is it warm or cold? Does it cast shadows?), and perhaps even a faint scent associated with it. This would further emphasize its otherworldly nature.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Hint of Immediate Conflict or Mystery:** The story ends with Elias asking \"Where did this lead?\" which is a good hook. However, for a slightly more immediate impact, you could add a small, perplexing detail related to the map's discovery or its contents that introduces a slight element of unease or immediate intrigue. For example, perhaps finding the map coincided with a strange, unexplainable event at the lighthouse, or a specific symbol on the map seems eerily familiar yet impossible.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the worn grooves of the lighthouse railing, the salt spray a familiar kiss on his weathered face. For twenty years, his life had been dictated by the rhythm of the waves and the sweep of the beam, a solitary existence he’d chosen after the sea claimed his brother and, with him, Elias’s thirst for adventure. He’d thought his yearning for the unknown had drowned with his sibling, but the map changed everything. Tucked beneath a loose stone near the lantern room, he found it. Not a logbook, nor a sailor’s forgotten trinket, but parchment, impossibly smooth and cool to the touch, like sea-worn glass. Etched with lines that pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence, the markings seemed to breathe with a cold, blue-green light that cast no shadows, only an ethereal glow. Islands he’d never seen, coastlines that defied known geography, all shimmered with an eerie, otherworldly radiance. It wasn't charted on any Admiralty list. As he unfurled the glowing map, a low, resonant hum filled the lantern room, a sound that vibrated not in his ears, but deep within his bones. A single, recurring symbol on the map – a spiral within a star – pulsed with a light that felt achingly familiar, yet utterly impossible. Elias, his heart thrumming a new, powerful beat against his ribs, a forgotten longing stirring within him, whispered, \"Where do you lead?\"\nCriticAgent > Here are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Strengthen the Connection Between Elias's Past and the Map's Discovery:** The detail about his brother is a strong motivator, but the connection to the map could be more direct. For instance, does the \"spiral within a star\" symbol resemble something his brother used to draw, or was it part of a story his brother told? Making this symbol more than just \"achingly familiar\" and linking it to a specific memory or object of his brother's would deepen Elias's personal stake in the map's mystery.\n\n2.  **Enhance the \"Hum\" and its Effect:** The \"low, resonant hum\" is a good sensory detail, but its effect could be amplified. Instead of just vibrating \"deep within his bones,\" describe how it physically or emotionally impacts Elias. Does it make him feel dizzy, invigorated, or afraid? Does it momentarily blur his vision or cause a tingling sensation? This would make the map's influence more tangible.\n\n3.  **Consider a Micro-Moment of Foreshadowing:** Before Elias asks \"Where do you lead?\", you could add a very brief, subtle detail that hints at the *nature* of what lies beyond the map. This could be a sudden gust of wind that sounds like a whisper, a fleeting shadow that seems to move independently, or even the lighthouse beam itself faltering for a split second. This would add an extra layer of intrigue and anticipation to his question.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the worn grooves of the lighthouse railing, the salt spray a familiar kiss on his weathered face.

A single, recurring symbol on the map – a spiral within a star – pulsed with a light that felt achingly familiar. Liam had drawn it endlessly in the margins of his schoolbooks, a secret sigil Elias had never understood. Elias, his heart thrumming a new, powerful beat against his ribs, a forgotten longing stirring within him, felt a sudden, inexplicable chill despite the humid air, as if a spectral wind had just passed through the room. He whispered, \"Where do you lead?\"\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":46},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You've now implemented a loop agent, creating a sophisticated system that can iteratively review and improve its own output.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
